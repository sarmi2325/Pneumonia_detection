## Grad-CAM Visualization

The model highlights regions of the chest X-ray that contributed most to the final prediction using Grad-CAM, offering transparency and aiding clinical trust.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to:
- Upload X-ray images.
- View predictions from all 3 models and ensemble output.
- See class probabilities.
- Visualize Grad-CAM for each model.

---

## üß™ How Ensemble Works

Each model predicts the probability of Pneumonia. The final prediction is a **weighted average** of all models:

\[
\text{Prediction} = 0.2 \times \text{SimpleCNN} + 0.3 \times \text{MobileNetV2} + 0.5 \times \text{EfficientNetB0}
\]

Weights were selected based on validation performance.
